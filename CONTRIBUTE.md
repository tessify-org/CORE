# Challenges ahead

It's always hard the first time you do something. Especially when you are collaborating, making mistakes isn't an easy thing. We wanted to simplify the way new open-source contributors learn and contribute for the first time.

Reading articles and watching tutorials can help, but what's better than actually doing the stuff in a practice environment? 
This is how you can [build](https://github.com/tessify-org/CORE/wiki#installation-instructions) your own Tessify-CORE [PoC environment](https://github.com/tessify-org/CORE-PoC).

The CORE is built on top of the Laravel framework.
Here you can find free [reading](https://coursesity.com/free-tutorials-learn/laravel), [learning](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-6-from-scratch/episodes/1) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zckH4xalOns&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hL6aCFKyagrT1RCfVN4w2Q) material which can help get familiar with the framework.

This page aims at providing guidance and simplifying the way beginners make their first contribution. If you are looking to make your first contribution, follow the steps below.
